# keras-mura-CNN

deep convolutional model aimed at detecting abnormalities in x-ray imaging. data obtained as part of the Stanford MURA competition. this project served as my hands-on opportunity to practice the mathematics of convolution, more complex model architectures, and apply machine learning principles to meaningful real-world problems.
