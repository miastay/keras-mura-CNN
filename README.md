# keras-mura-CNN

deep convolutional model aimed at detecting abnormalities in x-ray imaging. data obtained as part of the Stanford MURA competition. this project served as my hands-on opportunity to practice the mathematics of convolution, more complex model architectures, and apply machine learning principles to meaningful real-world problems.

code primarily written Oct-Dec 2019; uploaded 2020.

special thanks to Steven Anton, my high school computer science teacher, for letting me sit in the back of his class and wrestle with my deep learning textbook for a GPA.
